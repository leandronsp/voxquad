# VoxQuad ðŸŽµ

A browser-based SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) voice synthesizer that lets you create four-part vocal harmonies using Web Audio synthesis.

VoxQuad simulates a vocal quartet right in your browser. Using formant synthesis technology, it creates sounds for four different voice types, allowing you to compose and play back harmonic progressions.

## Features

- **4-Voice Synthesis**: Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass voices with synthetic formants
- **Interactive Matrix**: Visual grid for composing 4-measure progressions  
- **Smart Autocomplete**: Quick note and chord selection
- **Real-time Playback**: Instant audio feedback with Web Audio API
- **Individual Voice Control**: Adjust volume for each voice independently

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.4+
- Rails 8.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voxquad.git
cd voxquad
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Start the server
```bash
rails server
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Use

### Creating a Composition

1. **Select Chords** (optional): Choose a chord for each measure to guide your harmony
2. **Choose Notes**: Click on each voice box to select notes for each measure
3. **Play**: Click the "Play Composition" button to hear your creation

### Voice Controls

- **Master Volume**: Controls overall playback volume
- **Individual Voices**: Adjust the mix of Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass

### Tips

- The default progression (G-F-Fm-C) demonstrates a classic harmonic movement
- Try keeping common tones between chords for smoother voice leading
- Bass notes typically match the chord root for stability

## Technology Stack

- **Rails 8**: Modern web framework with importmap for JavaScript
- **Web Audio API**: Browser-native audio synthesis
- **Custom CSS**: Clean, purpose-built styling
- **No Database**: Pure client-side application
- **Formant Synthesis**: Acoustic modeling for vocal sounds

## Audio Engine Technical Details

VoxQuad's audio synthesis is built using the Web Audio API and implements several acoustic modeling techniques to simulate vocal sounds:

### Formant Synthesis
The heart of VoxQuad's voice simulation uses [formant synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant). Formants are resonant frequencies of the human vocal tract that give each vowel sound its characteristic timbre. Our implementation:

- Uses sawtooth [oscillators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode) to simulate vocal cord vibration
- Applies two peaking filters in series to create formant resonances (F1 and F2)
- Scales formant frequencies for different voice types (Soprano: 1.2x, Alto: 1.1x, Tenor: 1.0x, Bass: 0.85x)

### Web Audio API Architecture
The synthesis chain uses native browser [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API#audio_context) components:

1. **OscillatorNode** - Generates the fundamental frequency
2. **BiquadFilterNode** - Creates formant resonances (2 peaking filters per voice)
3. **BiquadFilterNode** - Lowpass filter to remove harsh harmonics
4. **GainNode** - Individual voice and master volume control

### ADSR Envelope
Each voice uses an [ADSR envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) implemented with [GainNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode) automation:
- **Attack**: 50ms fade-in
- **Decay**: 50ms to 90% of peak
- **Sustain**: Held at 90% for note duration
- **Release**: 100ms fade-out

### Voice Characteristics
Each SATB voice has distinct acoustic properties based on human vocal ranges and formant research:
- **Soprano**: Brighter formants, higher resonances
- **Alto**: Warmer mid-range formants
- **Tenor**: Balanced reference formants
- **Bass**: Darker, lower formant frequencies

## Development

The app uses Rails' importmap for JavaScript modules - no webpack or node_modules needed!

To add new features:
1. Identify the appropriate module (music-theory, audio-engine, or ui-controls)
2. Add your code to that module
3. Import what you need using Rails importmap conventions
